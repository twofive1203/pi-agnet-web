# Architecture Overview

This document holds the architecture details that should not live in `AGENTS.md`.

```

## Key Boundaries

- Session browsing does not create an AgentSession: API routes read `.jsonl` files through `lib/session-reader.ts`; the only write side effect is pruning stale sessions whose cwd points at a deleted WorkTree.
- Sending commands creates or reuses an in-process AgentSession through `lib/rpc-manager.ts`.
- Client state and SSE streaming behavior are centralized in `hooks/useAgentSession.ts`.
- File viewing and workspace metadata use explicit API routes under `app/api/files/`, `app/api/cwd/`, and `app/api/git/`.

## Project Invariants

### AgentSession lifecycle

- Keep one `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id in `globalThis.__piSessions`; hot reload makes plain module-level maps unsafe.
- Idle timeout is 10 minutes.
- Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls must share `globalThis.__piStartLocks`.
- After `send("fork")`, capture the new session id and destroy the wrapper immediately. `AgentSession.fork()` mutates `inner.sessionId`; leaving the old wrapper alive can corrupt `parentSession` chains.

### Branching model

- Fork creates a new `.jsonl` file and is shown as a child in the sidebar via the header `parentSession` field.
- In-session branch uses `navigate_tree` within the same file. Multiple entries may share a `parentId`; switching branches calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files

- `parentSession` is display metadata only and does not affect chat content.
- Session files are fully rewritable when updating display metadata such as cascade reparenting on delete.
- Deleting or archiving a linked Git WorkTree also deletes session JSONL files whose `cwd` points at that WorkTree; session listing also prunes stale missing `*.worktrees/*` cwd sessions left by older versions.
- Orphaned sessions whose first line cannot be parsed as a valid header are marked `orphaned: true` and displayed as incomplete, not clickable.

### Archive path

Archived sessions are stored at:

```text
~/.pi/agent/sessions-archive/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl
```

Archive/unarchive is a pure file move (`renameSync`) between `sessions/` and `sessions-archive/`. The session JSONL content is never modified. Active RPC sessions are destroyed before the file is moved.

The archive directory is scanned separately from `SessionManager.listAll()` (which only scans `sessions/`). Project visibility is preserved by returning `archivedCwds` and `archivedCounts` from `GET /api/sessions`, allowing the CWD picker to include projects that have only archived sessions.

### Tool calls and events

- Pi stores tool calls as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}`.
- Web UI types use `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`.
- Normalize with `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts`; it is used during file load and streaming.
- Newer pi emits `compaction_start` / `compaction_end`; older pi emits `auto_compaction_start` / `auto_compaction_end`. Handle both.

### Session file-change projection

- Session changed-file UI is sidecar-based and non-Git; do not derive it from `git status` or `git diff`.
- `lib/rpc-manager.ts` forwards live edit/write tool events to `lib/session-file-changes.ts`, which captures bounded before/after text snapshots and persists `~/.pi/agent/session-changes/<session-id>.json`.
- Session JSONL files are not modified for this UI-only projection.
- MVP tracks built-in `edit` and `write` tools only; arbitrary `bash` file mutations are not shown unless a future scanner/sandbox design adds explicit support.

### Models and tools

- `GET /api/models` returns `defaultModel` from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.
- New-session tool names are passed to `POST /api/agent/new` as `toolNames[]`.
- Existing sessions infer presets via `get_tools` and `getPresetFromTools()`.
- Auth changes call `reloadRpcAuthState()` so live AgentSessions reload auth/model state. The same path also cleans pi-ai session resources because OpenAI Codex keeps reusable WebSockets keyed by session id, and those sockets must reconnect after ChatGPT account activation to pick up new auth headers.
- ChatGPT usage auto-refresh is backend-owned, not browser-tab-owned. The scheduler state lives on `globalThis.__piChatGptUsageRefreshScheduler` and uses `~/.pi/agent/chatgpt-usage-refresh.lock` to reduce duplicate refresh loops across Node processes. Stale lock detection follows the configured refresh cycle dynamically.
- Trellis subagent child processes resolve model policy from `pi-web.json` `trellis.subagents`: explicit tool input wins, then per-agent fixed policy, then optional route table policy, then default policy, then `.pi/agents/*` frontmatter, then Pi CLI defaults. Automatic routing is opt-in and classifies `text`/`multimodal` plus `simple`/`standard`/`complex`/`critical`; router failures fall back to configured safe route/default behavior. The default policy follows the main session model when the Pi extension context exposes it; otherwise it safely falls back to Pi default. If the selected child model process fails, existing `.pi/agents/*` `fallbackModels` frontmatter entries are retried in order; if those also fail and the main session model is known, the child finally falls back to the main session model.
- Session-scoped Trellis task association remains high-confidence only (session transcript evidence or exact per-session runtime pointers). When evidence identifies a child task, the web projection promotes it to the nearest available parent task so the floating widget represents the main task context without mutating Trellis metadata.
- When all tools are disabled, `lib/rpc-manager.ts` clears the agent system prompt.

## Session File Format

Default location:

```text
~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl
```

Typical records:

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"provider":"zenmux","modelId":"claude-sonnet-4-6","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...]}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":0}
{"type":"session_info","id":"...","parentId":"...","name":"user-defined name"}
```

`entryIds[]` in `SessionContext` is parallel to `messages[]` and maps displayed messages back to `.jsonl` entry ids for fork and `navigate_tree` commands.
