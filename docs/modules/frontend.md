## Components

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `components/AppShell.tsx` | Top-level layout, URL state, tab management, Web Terminal bottom-dock toggling, right drawer mode switching between files and optional Trellis tasks, and Trellis-task-to-chat context block insertion. |

## Hooks

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |

## Styles

Global CSS lives in `app/globals.css`. Components may reference these CSS variables directly:

```text
--bg --bg-panel --bg-hover --bg-selected --bg-subtle --border
--text --text-muted --text-dim --accent --accent-hover
--user-bg --assistant-bg --tool-bg --font-mono
```

They are also mapped to Tailwind `--color-*` utility aliases. The theme toggles by adding/removing `dark` on `document.documentElement`.
