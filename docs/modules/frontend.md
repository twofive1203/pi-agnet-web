## Styles

Global CSS lives in `app/globals.css`. Components may reference these CSS variables directly:

```text
--bg --bg-panel --bg-hover --bg-selected --bg-subtle --border
--text --text-muted --text-dim --accent --accent-hover
--user-bg --assistant-bg --tool-bg --font-mono
```

They are also mapped to Tailwind `--color-*` utility aliases. The theme toggles by adding/removing `dark` on `document.documentElement`.
