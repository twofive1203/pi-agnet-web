# API Module Map

| Route | Methods | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessions/` | GET | List sessions grouped by cwd (includes `archivedCwds` and `archivedCounts`). |
| `sessions/[id]/` | GET/PATCH/DELETE | Read session detail, rename, delete. Returns `archived: true` for archived sessions. |
| `sessions/[id]/context/` | GET | Get context for a specific `leafId`. |
| `sessions/[id]/changes/` | GET | List files changed by tracked agent file tools in this session from non-Git sidecar data. |

| `sessions/[id]/export/` | GET | Export session as Markdown. |
| `sessions/new/` | 410 | Deprecated route kept for compatibility. |
| `agent/new/` | POST | Create a new session and send the first message. |

| `trellis/workflow/` | GET | Read and parse the selected workspace `.trellis/workflow.md` into a read-only workflow visualization projection with phases, steps, workflow-state blocks, source line ranges, and parser warnings. |
| `trellis/workflow/assist/` | POST | Use the configured Trellis workflow assistant model to translate and summarize one selected workflow node's guidance text without mutating `.trellis/workflow.md`. |

| `trellis/setup/init/` | POST | Install/ensure the Trellis CLI, run `trellis init -u <developer> --pi` for an authorized uninitialized workspace, and auto-enable the Trellis drawer setting on success. |

| `default-cwd/` | POST | Create and return `~/pi-cwd-<YYYYMMDD>`. |
| `home/` | GET | Return `os.homedir()`. |
| `usage/` | GET | Aggregate token/cost usage across active-only or active-plus-archived sessions based on `pi-web.json` Usage settings. |

| `auth/all-providers/` | GET | List all known provider ids. |
| `auth/accounts/[provider]/` | GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE | List saved OAuth accounts, import one or more raw/CPA/SUB2API OAuth account JSON entries, update account remarks/extra info, return cached quota reset metadata, and soft-delete inactive saved accounts for supported providers (`openai-codex`). |
| `auth/accounts/[provider]/activate/` | POST | Activate a saved OAuth account and reload live RPC auth state. |
| `auth/login/[provider]/` | GET/POST | Initiate OAuth login for a provider; `openai-codex?accountMode=add` saves another account without replacing active auth. |

POST consumes one available Codex reset credit for the active account or JSON `{ accountId }`, then returns freshly queried quota. |
| `auth/warmup/openai-codex/` | GET/POST | GET returns recent ChatGPT/Codex warmup history and lazily ensures the local scheduler. POST warms selected saved OAuth accounts by sending a tiny real Codex request without activating them; returns per-account results, records manual run history, and refreshes quota cache when possible. |

| `chatgpt/usage-refresh/run/` | POST | Trigger a best-effort immediate ChatGPT usage refresh cycle through the backend scheduler. |

## Implementation Pointers

- Agent command routes should go through `lib/rpc-manager.ts`.
- Session-file routes should use `lib/session-reader.ts` and shared types in `lib/types.ts`.
- Client-side command calls should use `lib/agent-client.ts`.
- Normalize streamed/file-loaded tool calls through `lib/normalize.ts`.
